# Reads age and name and outputs same
# Author: Niall O Flaherty

name = input('What is your name')
# age = int(input('What is your age')) - I thought because there was a number involved, it would have to be converted
# This is not the case as we are not adding numbers.

age = input('What is your age')
print ('Hello ' + name + '.\tYour age is ' + age)
# It took a few minutes of trial and error to get this working
