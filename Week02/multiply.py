# In this Lab, we are asked to create a program to output what 111 * 555 is
# answer = 111 * 555 .... WHY DOES THIS NOT PRINT ANYTHING?
# When the above was tried, there was a syntax error
# When I tried a simple: 111 * 555 .... THIS DID NOT WORK EITHER, just a blank response
# I think this is because I did not tell the program to actually print out the result, this is done by placing print before the equation


print (111 * 555)
# This now outputs the answer: 61605
