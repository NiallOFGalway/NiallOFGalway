# This program asks you to input your name and gives a response after entering your name

name = input ("Please enter your name")
# This asks the person to enter their name, hence an INPUT

print('Hello ' + name + '.\nNice to meet you')
# This will output whatever the user input as their name, as we defined 'name' above
